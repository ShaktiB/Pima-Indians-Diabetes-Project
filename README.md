# Pima-Indians-Diabetes-Analysis

This aim of this project is to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on various diagnostic measures. The dataset is originall from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. I came across this dataset on Kaggle, and further information regarding the context of the data can be found by opening the link below.

Further insight into the data itself and understanding of its applications were obtained by going through the following research paper: 'Using the ADAP Learning Algorithm to Forecast the Onset of Diabetes Mellitus'

## Introduction

The goal of this project was to predict the onset of diabetes based on health metrics. The patients are all females 
that are atleast 21 years old. The metric provided in the dataset are: 

- Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
- Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
- BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
- SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
- Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
- BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function
- Age: Age (years)
- Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1)

## Data Exploration

The data was explored using different methods to obtain a sense of how the data is **distributed** and **correlated** with the presence of diabetes and with other features. Data visualizations such as **histograms**, **pair plots**, and **heat maps** helped obtain a statistical understanding of the data. 

Some examples of the visualizations are displayed below:
