# Pima-Indians-Diabetes-Analysis

This aim of this project is to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on various diagnostic measures. The dataset is originall from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. I came across this dataset on Kaggle, and further information regarding the context of the data can be found by opening the link below.

Further insight into the data itself and understanding of its applications were obtained by going through the following research paper: 'Using the ADAP Learning Algorithm to Forecast the Onset of Diabetes Mellitus'

## Helpful Resources
I used various kernels to get some guidance for different parts of the project, such as handling inconsistent data and properly developing predictive model. There are lots of good kernels available for reference on Kaggle for this particular dataset. I am listing links to some key Kaggle users whos' kernels I found useful.

**This data set contains imbalanced data for both classes (diabetes and no diabetes). When developing machine learning models, it is 
very important that this imbalance is adressed. The link provided below provided valuable insight into how this issue can be adressed 
using different techniques to help improve model selection and opimization.**
