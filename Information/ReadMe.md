## Helpful Resources
I used various kernels to get some guidance for different parts of the project, such as handling inconsistent data and properly developing predictive model. There are lots of good kernels available for reference on Kaggle for this particular dataset. I am listing links to some key Kaggle users whos' kernels I found useful.

**This data set contains imbalanced data for both classes (diabetes and no diabetes). When developing machine learning models, it is 
very important that this imbalance is adressed. The links provided below provided valuable insight into how this issue can be adressed 
using different techniques to help improve model selection and opimization.**
